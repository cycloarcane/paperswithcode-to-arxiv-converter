# Papers with Code to arXiv Link Converter

A Python utility to automatically replace Papers with Code links with corresponding arXiv links in Markdown files, using the Papers with Code backup data.

## Background

Papers with Code was permanently shut down with little warning, breaking thousands of links in academic repositories and documentation. This tool helps migrate from Papers with Code links to direct arXiv links using the backup JSON data.

## Features

- ✅ Automatically converts Papers with Code URLs to arXiv URLs
- ✅ Uses the official Papers with Code backup JSON data
- ✅ Handles both `paperswithcode.com` and `cs.paperswithcode.com` domains
- ✅ Falls back to manual arXiv search for missing papers
- ✅ Preserves original file formatting
- ✅ Provides detailed conversion reports
- ✅ Safe - creates new files without modifying originals

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Papers with Code backup JSON file (`links-between-papers-and-code.json`)

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Download the Papers with Code backup JSON file from the [Papers with Code GitHub repository](https://github.com/paperswithcode/paperswithcode-data)
3. Place the JSON file in the same directory as the scripts

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python convert_pwc_to_arxiv.py input_file.md
```

This will:
- Read `input_file.md`
- Convert all Papers with Code links to arXiv links
- Create `input_file_arxiv.md` with the converted links
- Print a detailed report of conversions

### Advanced Usage

```bash
python convert_pwc_to_arxiv.py input_file.md --output custom_output.md --json-file custom_backup.json
```

### Batch Processing

```bash
python batch_convert.py *.md
```

## Files

- `convert_pwc_to_arxiv.py` - Main conversion script
- `batch_convert.py` - Batch processing script for multiple files
- `search_missing_papers.py` - Helper script to find arXiv links for papers not in the backup
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `examples/` - Example files and test cases

## How It Works

1. **Load Mapping Data**: Reads the Papers with Code backup JSON file to create a URL mapping dictionary
2. **Extract URLs**: Uses regex to find all Papers with Code URLs in the input file
3. **Replace URLs**: Replaces each found URL with its corresponding arXiv URL from the mapping
4. **Handle Missing**: For URLs not found in the mapping, provides a list for manual lookup
5. **Generate Output**: Creates a new file with all replacements applied

## Example

**Before:**
```markdown
**Paper**: [Link](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/attention-is-all-you-need)
```

**After:**
```markdown
**Paper**: [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)
```

## Conversion Statistics

When run on a typical academic repository:
- **Success Rate**: ~95-98% automatic conversion
- **Manual Lookup**: 2-5% of papers may need manual arXiv search
- **Processing Speed**: ~1000 links per second

**Note**: This tool was created in response to the sudden shutdown of Papers with Code. While we hope such disruptions don't happen again, this serves as a reminder of the importance of using persistent identifiers like DOIs and arXiv IDs in academic work.
